![Comparing the brain and a supercomputer](/images/compare_brain_fugaku_1.png){: .align-right width="400px"}
I've just finished my PhD at the University of Lorraine, France, working in the LORIA's team BISCUIT under the supervision of Bernard Girau.

Brains are incredibly efficient computing systems. 
Weighing just 1.5 kg and occupying a modest 0.02 m², brains delivers 600 petaFlops.
In comparison, even the renowned supercomputer Fugaku, with its colossal weight of 640,000 kg and expansive surface area of 1920 m², can only muster around 415 petaFlops.
What's more, while the brain operates efficiently, consuming a mere 20 W of power – equivalent to a lightbulb – Fugaku devours 30,000,000 W, akin to the energy output of a hydroelectric power plant.

Driven by this fascination for the brain, my research focuses on Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), neuromorphic computing, and neuromorphic sensors. 
Specifically, I am dedicated to developing learning algorithms tailored for SNNs.
